-- Overworld locomotion classification and tuning for Gen 1.
--
-- Pokemon Stadium's battle model set does not contain a universal named
-- "walk" clip. The overworld bridge therefore reuses each species' second
-- standby loop when one exists and drives it from actual distance travelled,
-- then adds a small step/bob so the model visibly walks even when its Stadium
-- pack only has an idle loop.
--
-- v0.1.17 broadens walking beyond the earlier grounded-biped-only set.
-- The user specifically wanted basically every NON-FLYING-TYPE Pokemon to walk,
-- even if some of them are really just doing a simple waddle. We therefore make
-- every Gen 1 species eligible except the canonical Flying-type Pokemon, while
-- still allowing per-species overrides from the config file.
